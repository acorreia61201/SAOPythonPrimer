    "\\begin{equation}\n",

    "Recall that we're taking the angular position $\\theta$ into consideration, with $\\theta = 0$ corresponding to the equilibrium state of the pendulum (i.e. hanging straight down).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your task:** As practice, use `sympy` to write this equation. $\\theta$ will be a function of $t$, so make sure you define it accordingly. The result should look just like the equation above (or at least very close). There are no restrictions on the variables above, but you may define the parameters $m, l, g$ to be positive if you wish."

    "There are many ways to derive this equation. One way is by using the *Euler-Lagrange equations*, an alternative physics formulation to the Newton's laws you're probably familiar with. This formulation uses *generalized coordinates* as an analogue to the $x$ and $y$ coordinates more commonly used throughout physics. Since a pendulum moves along an arc of a circle, it's much more convenient to use *polar coordinates* to model the system:\n",

    "(We've seemingly swapped the definitions from what you may be used to, but recall that we're defining the negative $y$-axis to be $\\theta = 0$.) In this situation, $r = l$ is a constant, so we only need to consider the equation of motion for $\\theta$. For Lagrangian mechanics, we need to consider the two sources of energy in the system. The first is the *kinetic energy* $T$, defined for any system as:\n",
