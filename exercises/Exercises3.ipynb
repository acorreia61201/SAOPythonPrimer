    "\n",
    "A *palindrome* is a word (or number) that reads the same when spelled backwards (e.g. \"racecar\", \"wow\", \"kayak\").\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your task:** Write a function `is_palindrome()` that takes a string as an input and determines whether it is a palindrome. (Hint: try using the `reverse()` method on a string.) The function should print a statement that tells me whether or not the input is a palindrome. Test it with some words to see if it works (numbers expressed as strings should work too)."

    "**Your task:** Modify `is_palindrome()` (you can copy it below or modify it above) to make all letters in your string one case (i.e. uppercase or lowercase) and remove punctuation. Save the original string so you can print it out as part of your output. Try it below; the function should work with single words as well as full phrases.\n",
    "\n",
    "(Hint: for the former, you can use the Python built-ins `lower()` or `upper()`, which respectively makes all letters in the string lowercase or uppercase. For the latter, see https://datagy.io/python-remove-punctuation-from-string/ and https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-remove-spaces-from-a-string/#. I found it most helpful to use a loop iterating over `string.punctuation` and using the `replace()` method on the strings to remove spaces and punctuation. You'll have to do in-place modifications each time you use `replace()` (i.e. string = string.replace()) to save the changes.)"

(Hint: `range()` may not produce a list, but `list(range())` will.) To practice with iteration and using `range()`, try to refrain from using more convenient methods (e.g. from other libraries); we'll cover them in the next lecture."
