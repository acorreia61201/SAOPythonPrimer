    "\n",
    "We've covered `numpy`, which is a powerful library in its own right. However, there are some common mathematical problems that would be convenient to have on-hand when doing scientific programming. The `scipy` library is designed specifically for this. It builds upon the functionality of `numpy` to include hundreds of functions that span the breadth of mathematics. Talking about every single thing that you can do with `scipy` would take a summer in itself, so for now we'll cover some of the most notable functionalities of the library.\n",
