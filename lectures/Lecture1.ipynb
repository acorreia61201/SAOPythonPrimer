    "## Intro to Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this week, we will be using Jupyter Notebook during lectures and exercises. It's used throughout software development for visualization and short, modular codes like the ones you'll be seeing this week. There are several ways to download, edit, and run these notebooks:\n",
    "\n",
    "- For this week, I recommend using Colab (https://colab.research.google.com/). It's an online service that allows you to run notebooks on Google servers and requires no setup. Each notebook in Github should have a link that takes you directly to Colab.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you'd prefer, you can also download the notebooks and open them using VSCode or Jupyter Notebook via Anaconda. It takes a bit of work to get these set up, but if you already have them installed it should be relatively easy to get the notebooks working once downloaded.\n",
    "\n",
    "However you decide to access these notebooks, you should now be able to run the code below. This is a *cell*. You can run the cell below using the play button (in Colab, it will show up to the left when you hover over it). \n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, you can click on the cell and use one of two keyboard shortcuts:\n",
    "- Shift + Enter will run the cell and automatically move you to the next cell\n",
    "- Ctrl/Cmd + Enter will run the cell without moving you forward\n",
    "\n",
    "For Colab users, you may get a warning on your first run. You can click \"Run Anyway\" if the notebook comes from a trusted source (which hopefully includes me)."

Instead, it stores the number using a certain amount of bits (a.k.a. some combination of powers of 2). Python defaults to using double-precision, which stores numbers on 53 bits. This means that the results from arithmetic can vary from the true value by $\\sim 2^{-53} \\sim 10^{-16}$, as seen here.\n",
