    "Over the course of this summer and your programming career, you're guaranteed to encounter a multitude of errors when developing and running code. This isn't a matter of experience; even the best programmers run into them all the time. What defines a good programmer is understanding how to quickly detect and fix errors when they show up. For the first half of this lecture, we'll go over some strategies to recognize and handle some common Python errors.\n",

This is basically Python's way of saying \"I don't understand you\". In this particular example, we can see the error name in red and a short description describing what went wrong. Here, we get `unexpected EOF while parsing`. *EOF* stands for end-of-file, and this message basically means that the Python interpreter reached the end of your code without seeing an ending parenthesis.\n",

For example, let's say I wanted to write a function that squares an input:"
