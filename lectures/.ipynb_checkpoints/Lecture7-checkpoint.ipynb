The `read_*()` functions are used to read in data as a `DataFrame`, and the `to_*()` functions are used to export a `DataFrame` to an external file.

    "The hardest errors to catch are conceptual errors, which may arise from typos from data entry. For example, looking in the Duration column, we see one value of 450 among a bunch of 45s and 60s. If we're interpreting this column as lengths of workout sessions in minutes, a value of 450 (7.5 hours) is pretty unlikely. \n",

In this case, we'll set the upper limit for a reasonable workout to be 120 minutes, or 2 hours. To iterate, we can use the attribute `index`, which contains an iterable of the indices of the rows in the dataset. "
