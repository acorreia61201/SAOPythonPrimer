    "## Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we've covered functions, you could theoretically write any function you want to do practically whatever you want. However, with how popular Python has become in the past few years, it's very likely that someone else has written a function to do whatever you want to do, with the added benefit of being stress-tested and probably way more efficient than you could write. For example, I mentioned that you should use built-ins whenever possible rather than your own functions. This is because, while built-ins can potentially do very simple things (case in point: look how simply you can write your own version of the `pow()` function), they're usually written in lower-level languages that are much faster than Python. This increase in efficiency becomes instrumental once you start writing more intensive codes when doing, e.g., machine learning research or parallel computing.\n",
    "\n",
    "While base Python has a lot of built-in functions to get you started doing simple arithmetic and STEM problems (like those you've been doing in the problem sets), not everything you can do in Python comes pre-packaged. Instead, a huge majority of what you can do in Python is relegated to *libraries*, external sources containing functions that are too complex or specialized to include in base Python. There are hundreds of millions of libraries out there - so much that you could probably dedicate your whole life to learning libraries and still not get to them all. Over the summer, you'll encounter several of the most widely-used libraries in scientific programming, many of which will be instrumental to your success many years after this course.\n",
