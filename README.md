# SAO/LIP Python Primer Course
June 6 - 9, 2023

Instructor: Alex Correia

Welcome to the Python Primer section of the SAO Fellowship Program! This series of notebooks should act as an introduction to scientific programming in Python in preparation for the rest of the summer. Over the course of the week we'll cover:

- Basic Python syntax
- Loops
- Functions
- Numpy and advanced arithmetic
- Pandas and Python I/O
- Matplotlib and data visualization
- General programming practices (debugging, basic algorithms, code etiquette)
- If time allows: Sympy and symbolic calculus, Object-oriented programming

There are two directories, each containing Jupyter Notebooks containing the material I intend to cover. Each lecture is paired with an exercise set with 4-6 problems that apply the material covered. We'll be going through them sequentially, as the material in later notebooks will build upon those before. Since the best way to learn programming in my experience is through hands-on work, I plan on dedicating the majority of the time to the open-ended exercise sets, which will cover some basic to intermediate coding problems throughout STEM. The lectures should take no more than an hour to present each, although this will of course vary per lecture. If you'd like, you can preview the material in the lecture notebooks, although you're by no means required to.

I've included ten lectures and exercise sets. Over the four-day course, I plan on going through two lectures and exercise sets per day on average, with two extra, more challenging notebooks in case we go faster than expected. I've tried to write these notebooks for a STEM undergraduate with no prior experience in Python, so we may deviate from this schedule depending on your collective experience in programming or math (mainly calculus and discrete math). The class is a small group with students from various backgrounds, so at any point feel free to reach out to me if you need clarification or would like me to adjust the pacing.
